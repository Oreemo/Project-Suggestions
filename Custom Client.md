# Overview
A completely rewritten (open source?) osu! client

# Features
1. Can be C# or C++ (or VB.Net if you really want to)
1. Should contain no code from the original osu! (Not that any of us has access to it, just saying!)
1. Should support most (if not all) of osu!'s features
1. Online, score submission and multiplayer support
1. Maybe some features that can give you unfair advantages? ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Notes
1. Bancho will have to be completely reversed/rewritten, and the game has to be completely rewritten (entire gameplay).
1. Need to check if it is legal to create a game that uses another game's servers.
