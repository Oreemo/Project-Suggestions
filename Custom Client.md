# Overview
A completely rewritten (, open source?) osu client

# Features
1. Can be C# or C++ (or php/Visual Basic if you really want to)
1. Should contain no code from the original osu (Not that any of us had access to it, just saying)
1. Should support most if not all of osu's features
1. Online, submittal and multiplayer support
1. Maybe some features that can give you unfair advantages? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
