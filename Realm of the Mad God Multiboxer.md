Should be pretty straightforward: This is a program that allows you to run multiple instances of the game Realm of the Mad God. There is already a multiboxer named KronkBoxer which costs a ton of money and this multiboxer should eliminate the need for KronkBoxer.

# Features
1. Safely multibox multiple instances of the game
2. Feature K-Relay support for special auto nexus and showing when a bag drops
