# Overview
Should be pretty straightforward: This program should search the internet for beatmaps and download them into the osu! Songs directory.

# Features
1. Don't download already installed maps
1. Add user defined blacklist for maps/songs/mappers/tags/...
1. Add other search criteria like Star Difficulty, Aproach Rate or BPM
1. Let the user select a prefered download site
1. Download maps to temporary folder and only add them to osu!'s Songs folder when osu isn't running or the user explicitely tells it to, to prevent play sessions from being interrupted by "That thing"
